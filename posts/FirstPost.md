Today marks the first day to attempt to document **how** I develop as a programmer. I will aim to report back at the end of every two or three days on what I have been working on and how it is shaping up so I guess I should get to it! 

I have in the last few days attempted to download and make work; Ruby on Rails, Vue.JS, and Drupal. All cards on the table the process of starting with Ruby on Rails has been fraught with difficulty. However I'm not disheartened by this as when I started making this blog with Next.JS it took me almost 3 days to get my head around all the seperate technologies at work. 

Vue.JS has been an interesting dalliance. I downloaded all the relevant libraries to create a Vue.JS application however after realising I could make one I didn't think whether or not I should create a web application as currently I don't have any particular projects in mind but the learning process was a fun experience none the same.

This did make me realise I wanted to create a Vanilla Javascript database and then implement some form of TypeScript, React, and/or Angular to make it more impressive. The database is a basic stock market that I intend to use for my online Dungeons & Dragon games one day. Once it is up and working I will add in GraphQL or some kind of graphic logic to make the database look prettier and easier to read. 

Finally I began my walk with Drupal. I have succesfully downloaded the prerequisites for Drupal with Docker, and ddev, plus a few more files that I am still decoding. (I may be wrong. It is all part of the learning experience.) I am excited for tomorrow as I get to delve deeper into what I can do with these technologies. 

Thank you for reading! Sam (Samuel, Samus 9001).
